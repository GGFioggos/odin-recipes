    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pre-cooking the eggplant is essential, but instead of frying the slices, you can lightly brush olive oil on both sides, place them in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake them in the oven at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), turning once halfway through.    </p>
    <p>You can lighten the meat sauce by using 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef instead of all beef.    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium eggplants, cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch slices<li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purple flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and place in a colander set in the sink or over a plate. Let sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour so the salt can draw out any bitterness.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make bechamel sauce. Heat milk in a saucepan almost to a boil. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour until a smooth paste forms. Lower heat and gradually pour in hot milk, whisking constantly until bechamel sauce thickens. Season with salt. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.        </li>
        <li>Rinse eggplant slices under cold running water. Squeeze out liquid and pat dry with paper towels. Whisk egg yolks into the cooled bechamel.        </li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet and cook eggplant slices in batches until each side is lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on a large plate lined with paper towels.        </li>

    </ol>
